# community-based learning
A website to host file uploading to a cloud for a particular english class.

[Community-based learning] is "an educational approach that integrates academic instruction with active community engagement and reflection to address real-world needs of the community." (MSU) 

As an excerise in sharing and spreading knowledge within the community, this is 100% optional and not at all required to pass the class. I thought it would be fun just to be able to read other people's papers to share information. The papers will not be held or saved anywhere other than canvas. This is also not a reflection of graded papers and will only be shared amongst students after we all know the grades for our paper or after we submit. Along with this not being a reflection, it is not extra credit for the assignment and will not inherently earn participating students a higher grade. 

At the end of the calendar year (December 31st, 2026) the website will be archived and no longer accessible unless everyone participating consents and wishes for it to remain up. 

This website will not track or store any user data and logins.
