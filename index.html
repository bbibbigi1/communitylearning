                <h1>About</h1>
                    <p>The website is made to host and upload the final papers of this english class.</p>
                    <p>It is completely opt in and nobody is obligated to upload if they are uncomfortable.</p>
                    <p>[Community-based learning] is "an educational approach that integrates academic instruction with active community engagement and reflection to address real-world needs of the community." (MSU)
                        
                    As an excerise in sharing and spreading knowledge within the community, this is 100% optional and not at all required to pass the class. I thought it would be fun just to be able to read other people's papers to share information.
                    The papers will not be held or saved anywhere other than canvas. </p>
                
                    <p>This is also not a reflection of graded papers and will only be shared amongst students after we all know the grades for our paper or after we submit them.
                    Along with this not being a reflection, it is not extra credit for the assignment and will not earn participating students a higher grade.</p>

                    <p>At the end of the calendar year (December 31st, 2026) the website will be archived and no longer accessible unless everyone participating consents and wishes for it to remain up.</p>

                    <p>This website will not track or store any user data and logins.</p>
